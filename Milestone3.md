## Key Findings 
Strong positive correlation between Total Beds and Total Homelessness (regions with higher homelessness tend to have more shelter capacity)
Men's shelter beds show the strongest correlation with total homelessness rates
Significant negative correlation between homelessness rates and beds-per-homeless-person (suggesting potential resource gaps in high-homelessness regions)
