# Understanding Homelesness in Canada

**Decision Intelligence Approach for discovering the solutions.**

*By: Leonid Monchinskyi*

Understanding Homelessness in Canada is a critical research area that examines the complex and multifaceted issue of homelessness across the country. This field of study aims to provide comprehensive insights into the scale, causes, and impacts of homelessness, as well as to inform evidence-based policies and interventions.

## Introduction
## Key Aspects of Understanding Homelessness in Canada
Scale and Demographics
As of 2024, an estimated 81,515 people were experiencing homelessness in Ontario alone, representing a 51% increase since 20163.

Nationally, it's estimated that between 30,000 and 35,000 people are homeless on any given night in Canada5.

Indigenous communities are disproportionately affected, with 33.10% of Canadian homeless coming from Indigenous backgrounds5.

Regional Disparities
Northern Ontario has seen a 204% increase in known homelessness since 2016, reaching 5,377 people in 20243.

Urban centers face significant pressures, serving as service hubs and key inflow points for people seeking support3.

Economic Impact
The annual cost of homelessness in Canada is estimated to be over $10 billion5.

Government Response
The Canadian Government is investing $4 billion over ten years to expand funding for the homeless5.

Significance of Studying Homelessness in Canada
Informs policy decisions and resource allocation at municipal, provincial, and federal levels.

Helps identify vulnerable populations and tailor support services.

Contributes to the development of effective strategies for prevention and intervention.

## Research Objectives

Assess the causes and contributing factors to homelessness across different regions.

Evaluate the effectiveness of current interventions and support systems.

Analyze the long-term economic and social impacts of homelessness on communities.

## Data Analysis

#### Key Performance Indicator (KPI): Chronic Homelessness

Definition:
Chronic homelessness is a key performance indicator (KPI) used to measure the number of individuals experiencing long-term or repeated homelessness over an extended period. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), a person is considered chronically homeless if they have been homeless for at least 12 consecutive months or on at least four separate occasions in the last three years, totaling 12 months, and have a disabling condition (such as a serious mental illness, substance use disorder, or physical disability).

#### Key Performance Indicator (KPI): Hidden Homelessness Demography

Definition:
Hidden homelessness refers to individuals who do not have permanent housing but are not visible in official homelessness counts because they are temporarily staying with friends or family, living in overcrowded or unsuitable housing, or using short-term accommodations such as motels. These individuals do not access shelters or formal support systems, making them difficult to track.

#### Key Performance Indicator (KPI): Homelessness Demography

Definition:
Homelessness demography refers to the statistical breakdown of individuals experiencing homelessness based on key demographic factors such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, family status, veteran status, and disability status. This KPI provides insights into who is most affected by homelessness, helping to shape targeted interventions and policies.

#### Key Performance Indicator (KPI): Total Homelessness

Definition:
Total homelessness refers to the overall number of individuals experiencing homelessness within a specific geographic area over a given period. This includes all forms of homelessness, such as unsheltered individuals (living in streets, cars, or abandoned buildings), those in emergency shelters, and individuals in transitional housing.

#### Key Performance Indicator (KPI): Total Beds in Shelters in Canada

Definition:
Total beds in shelters in Canada refers to the number of available emergency, transitional, and supportive housing beds designated for individuals experiencing homelessness across the country. This KPI includes beds in government-funded shelters, non-profit organizations, and faith-based housing programs.


### Example 1

# Chronic Homelesness 
The graph indicates fluctuation in the number of shelter users experiencing chronic homelessness between 2017 and 2021. There is an initial decrease from 2017 to 2018, followed by a peak in 2019, and then a decrease in 2020, with a slight rise in 2021.

### Example 2
# Hidden Homelesness Demography
This data suggests that hidden homelessness disproportionately affects younger adults. This could be due to factors such as:

Lack of job experience/opportunities: Younger individuals may have difficulty securing stable employment.

Housing affordability: Rising housing costs may make it difficult for young people to afford their own housing.

Family conflict/instability: Younger individuals may be more likely to experience family conflict that leads to homelessness.

Social network: Older people have a stronger social safety net.

 # Homelesness Demography
 The data reveals a trend of increasing homelessness with age up to a certain point, followed by a decline in older age groups.

Peak in Older Middle Age: The highest percentage of homeless individuals falls within the 55-64 age group (27%). This suggests that individuals nearing retirement age are particularly vulnerable.

Significant Middle Age Presence: The 35-44 and 45-54 age groups also represent substantial portions of the homeless population (22% and 21% respectively). This indicates a significant presence of middle-aged individuals experiencing homelessness.

Lower Representation in Younger Adults: While still a factor, the 15-34 age group has a lower percentage (17.4%) compared to the older middle-aged groups.

Lowest Representation in Seniors: The 65 and older group has the lowest percentage (13.2%). This could be due to factors such as increased access to social security or other senior-specific support programs, or a lower survival rate among homeless individuals as they age.

# Possible Interpretations & Considerations

Job Market Instability: The high percentage in the 55-64 age group could be linked to job market instability, age discrimination in hiring, or difficulty recovering from economic setbacks later in life.

Health Issues: Chronic health problems and lack of access to healthcare could contribute to homelessness in older age groups.

Need for Targeted Support: The data highlights the need for targeted support and preventative measures aimed at individuals in their late middle age to prevent homelessness.

 # Total Homelesness

 The strongest trend shown in this visualization is the significant concentration of homelessness in Ontario compared to other regions. Ontario accounts for by far the largest proportion (38%) of the total homelessness represented in the data. The other regions (Prairies, British Columbia, and Québec) have similar, moderate levels, while the Atlantic region has a comparatively small proportion.

Dominance of Ontario: The overwhelming size of the Ontario bubble immediately indicates its disproportionate share of the total homelessness.

Moderate Western and Central Regions: The Prairies, British Columbia, and Québec regions have relatively similar levels of homelessness compared to each other, suggesting similar factors might be at play in these areas.

Lower Homelessness in the Atlantic Region: The small size of the Atlantic bubble suggests a much lower overall incidence of homelessness compared to other parts of the represented area.

 # Total Bed Shelters
 The graph highlights the vast disparities in shelter bed availability across Canada, with Ontario having a substantially larger capacity than other provinces, particularly the Atlantic provinces and territories. This likely reflects a combination of factors, including population size, homelessness rates, and resource allocation.
