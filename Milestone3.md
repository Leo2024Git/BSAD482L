## Shelter Capacity and Homelessness Correlation

There's a strong positive correlation (approximately 0.91) between total shelter beds and total homelessness rates across regions.

Men's shelter beds show the strongest correlation with homelessness rates (0.87), followed by women's beds (0.78).

Family beds have a moderate correlation (0.62) with homelessness rates.

## Age Demographics Comparison
There's a moderate negative correlation (-0.52) between household age demographics and homeless population age demographics.

##### Notable differences in age distribution

The 55-64 age group is significantly overrepresented in the homeless population (27%) compared to general households (19%).

Young adults (15-34) are underrepresented in the homeless population (17.4%) compared to general households (24%).

Middle-aged adults (35-54) have similar representation in both populations.

## Resource Distribution by Region

Ontario has the highest absolute number of shelter beds but a moderate beds-per-homeless ratio.

The Territories region has the highest beds-per-homeless ratio (46.7 beds per homeless person).

Quebec has a relatively low beds-per-homeless ratio despite having a substantial homeless population.

## Gender Distribution in Homeless Population

Males make up 54% of the homeless population.
Females make up 46% of the homeless population.
This gender distribution correlates with the higher number of men's shelter beds compared to women's beds nationally.

## Shelter Type Correlations

Strong positive correlation between men's and women's shelter beds (0.79), suggesting similar geographic distribution.

Youth beds show strong correlation with total homelessness (0.79), indicating focused resources for younger homeless populations.

General beds have a weaker correlation with homelessness rates, suggesting they may be distributed based on factors other than homelessness prevalence.

## Age and Shelter Type Analysis

The higher proportion of older adults (55-64) in the homeless population may indicate a need for more specialized shelter resources for this demographic.

Youth shelter beds are relatively well-distributed compared to the youth homeless population percentage.

## Key Findings 
Strong positive correlation between Total Beds and Total Homelessness (regions with higher homelessness tend to have more shelter capacity).

Men's shelter beds show the strongest correlation with total homelessness rates.

Significant negative correlation between homelessness rates and beds-per-homeless-person (suggesting potential resource gaps in high-homelessness regions).

## Conclusion

Based on our correlation analysis of shelter capacity and homelessness data across Canadian regions, we've identified several important relationships that merit attention:

The data reveals a strong positive correlation between total shelter beds and homelessness rates across regions. This suggests that resource allocation is generally responsive to homelessness prevalence, with more shelter capacity typically provided in areas experiencing higher rates of homelessness. This relationship is particularly evident in Ontario, which has both the highest homelessness rate and the greatest number of shelter beds.

Different shelter types show varying relationships with homelessness rates. Men's shelter beds demonstrate the strongest correlation with overall homelessness, followed by women's beds and youth beds. Family beds show a more moderate correlation, while general beds have the weakest relationship with homelessness rates. These differences may reflect both the demographic composition of the homeless population (54% male, 46% female) and potentially different approaches to shelter resource allocation by type.

Regional analysis reveals notable differences in the shelter capacity to homelessness ratio. The Territories region has the highest beds-per-homeless-person ratio despite having the lowest absolute homelessness rate. In contrast, some regions with substantial homeless populations have relatively lower beds-per-homeless ratios, suggesting potential resource gaps. These regional variations highlight opportunities for more equitable distribution of shelter resources relative to local homelessness challenges.

The demographic data further contextualizes these findings, showing that older adults (55-64) are overrepresented in the homeless population compared to general households, which may indicate a need for specialized shelter resources for this growing demographic. 


**These findings suggest that while shelter capacity generally correlates with homelessness rates, there are demographic and regional disparities in resource allocation. The data indicates potential opportunities to better align shelter resources with the demographic profile of the homeless population, particularly for older adults and in regions with lower beds-per-homeless ratios.**
