# Chronic Homelesness 
The graph indicates fluctuation in the number of shelter users experiencing chronic homelessness between 2017 and 2021. There is an initial decrease from 2017 to 2018, followed by a peak in 2019, and then a decrease in 2020, with a slight rise in 2021.

# Hidden Homelesness Demography
This data suggests that hidden homelessness disproportionately affects younger adults. This could be due to factors such as:

Lack of job experience/opportunities: Younger individuals may have difficulty securing stable employment.

Housing affordability: Rising housing costs may make it difficult for young people to afford their own housing.

Family conflict/instability: Younger individuals may be more likely to experience family conflict that leads to homelessness.

Social network: Older people have a stronger social safety net.

 # Homelesness Demography
 The data reveals a trend of increasing homelessness with age up to a certain point, followed by a decline in older age groups.

Peak in Older Middle Age: The highest percentage of homeless individuals falls within the 55-64 age group (27%). This suggests that individuals nearing retirement age are particularly vulnerable.

Significant Middle Age Presence: The 35-44 and 45-54 age groups also represent substantial portions of the homeless population (22% and 21% respectively). This indicates a significant presence of middle-aged individuals experiencing homelessness.

Lower Representation in Younger Adults: While still a factor, the 15-34 age group has a lower percentage (17.4%) compared to the older middle-aged groups.

Lowest Representation in Seniors: The 65 and older group has the lowest percentage (13.2%). This could be due to factors such as increased access to social security or other senior-specific support programs, or a lower survival rate among homeless individuals as they age.

# Possible Interpretations & Considerations

Job Market Instability: The high percentage in the 55-64 age group could be linked to job market instability, age discrimination in hiring, or difficulty recovering from economic setbacks later in life.

Health Issues: Chronic health problems and lack of access to healthcare could contribute to homelessness in older age groups.

Need for Targeted Support: The data highlights the need for targeted support and preventative measures aimed at individuals in their late middle age to prevent homelessness.

 # Total Homelesness

 The strongest trend shown in this visualization is the significant concentration of homelessness in Ontario compared to other regions. Ontario accounts for by far the largest proportion (38%) of the total homelessness represented in the data. The other regions (Prairies, British Columbia, and Québec) have similar, moderate levels, while the Atlantic region has a comparatively small proportion.

Dominance of Ontario: The overwhelming size of the Ontario bubble immediately indicates its disproportionate share of the total homelessness.

Moderate Western and Central Regions: The Prairies, British Columbia, and Québec regions have relatively similar levels of homelessness compared to each other, suggesting similar factors might be at play in these areas.

Lower Homelessness in the Atlantic Region: The small size of the Atlantic bubble suggests a much lower overall incidence of homelessness compared to other parts of the represented area.

 # Total Bed Shelters
 The graph highlights the vast disparities in shelter bed availability across Canada, with Ontario having a substantially larger capacity than other provinces, particularly the Atlantic provinces and territories. This likely reflects a combination of factors, including population size, homelessness rates, and resource allocation.
